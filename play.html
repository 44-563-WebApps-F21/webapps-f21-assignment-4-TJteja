<br>
<h4 class="name LADY-STUTFIELD">LADY STUTFIELD</h4><p>  I suppose so, Mr. Dumby.  It’s been a delightful season,
hasn’t it?</p><br>
<h4 class="name DUMBY">DUMBY</h4><p>  Quite delightful!  Good evening, Duchess.  I suppose this will be
the last ball of the season?</p><br>
<h4 class="name DUCHESS-OF-BERWICK">DUCHESS OF BERWICK.</h4> <p> I suppose so, Mr. Dumby.  It has been a very dull
season, hasn’t it?</p><br>
<h4 class="name DUMBY">DUMBY.</h4> <p> Dreadfully dull!  Dreadfully dull!</p><br>
<h4 class="name MR.-COWPER-COWPER">MR. COWPER-COWPER.</h4><p>  Good evening, Mr. Dumby.  I suppose this will be the
last ball of the season?</p><br>
<h4 class="name DUMBY">DUMBY.</h4><p>  Oh, I think not.  There’ll probably be two more.</p>  
<p>[_Wanders back to_ LADY PLYMDALE.]</p><br>
<h4 class="name PARKER">PARKER.</h4><p>  Mr. Rufford.  Lady Jedburgh and Miss Graham.  Mr. Hopper. </p><br>
<p>[_These people enter as announced_.]</p><br>
<h4 class="name HOPPER">HOPPER.</h4><p>  How do you do, Lady Windermere?  How do you do, Duchess? </p>
 <p>[_Bows to_ LADY AGATHA.]</p><br>
<h3 class="name DUCHESS-OF-BERWICK">DUCHESS OF BERWICK.</h3> <p> Dear Mr. Hopper, how nice of you to come so early.
We all know how you are run after in London.</p><br>
<h4 class="name HOPPER">HOPPER.</h4>  <p>Capital place, London!  They are not nearly so exclusive in
London as they are in Sydney.</p><br>
<h4 class="name DUCHESS-OF-BERWICK">DUCHESS OF BERWICK.</h4><p>  Ah! we know your value, Mr. Hopper.  We wish there
were more like you.  It would make life so much easier.  Do you know, Mr.
Hopper, dear Agatha and I are so much interested in Australia.  It must
be so pretty with all the dear little kangaroos flying about.  Agatha has
found it on the map.  What a curious shape it is!  Just like a large
packing case.  However, it is a very young country, isn’t it?</p><br>
<h4 class="name HOPPER">HOPPER.</h4><p> Wasn’t it made at the same time as the others, Duchess?</p></h3><br>
<h4 class="name DUCHESS-OF-BERWICK">DUCHESS OF BERWICK.</h4> <p> How clever you are, Mr. Hopper.  You have a
cleverness quite of your own.  Now I mustn’t keep you.</p><br>
<h4 class="name HOPPER">HOPPER.</h4> <p> But I should like to dance with Lady Agatha, Duchess.</p><br>
<br>
<h4 class="name DUCHESS-OF-BERWICK">DUCHESS OF BERWICK.</h4><p>  Well, I hope she has a dance left.  Have you a dance
left, Agatha?</p><br>
<h4 class="name LADY-AGATHA">LADY AGATHA. </h4><p> Yes, mamma. </p><br>
<h4 class="name DUCHESS-OF-BERWICK">DUCHESS OF BERWICK.</h4><p>  The next one? </p><br>
<h4 class="name LADY-AGATHA">LADY AGATHA.</h4><p>  Yes, mamma. </p><br>
<h4 class="name HOPPER">HOPPER.</h4><p>  May I have the pleasure? </p>
<p> [LADY AGATHA _bows_.]</p><br>
<h4 class="name DUCHESS-OF-BERWICK">DUCHESS OF BERWICK.</h4><p>  Mind you take great care of my little chatterbox,
Mr. Hopper.</p><br>
<p>[LADY AGATHA _and_ MR. HOPPER _pass into ball-room_.]</p><br>
<p>[_Enter_ LORD WINDERMERE.]</p><br>
<h4 class="name LORD-WINDERMERE">LORD WINDERMERE.</h4><p>  Margaret, I want to speak to you.</p><br>
<h4 class="name LADY-WINDERMERE">LADY WINDERMERE.</h4><p>  In a moment. </p>
<p> [_The music drops_.]</p><br>
<h4 class="name PARKER">PARKER.</h4><p> Lord Augustus Lorton.</p><br>
<p>[_Enter_ LORD AUGUSTUS.]</p><br>
<h4 class="name LORD-AUGUSTUS">LORD AUGUSTUS.</h4><p>  Good evening, Lady Windermere.</p><br>
<h4 class="name DUCHESS-OF-BERWICK">DUCHESS OF BERWICK.</h4><p>  Sir James, will you take me into the ball-room?
Augustus has been dining with us to-night.  I really have had quite
enough of dear Augustus for the moment.</p><br>
<p>[SIR JAMES ROYSTON _gives the_ DUCHESS _his arm and escorts her into the
ball-room_.]</p><br>
<h4 class="name PARKER">PARKER.</h4><p>  Mr. and Mrs. Arthur Bowden.  Lord and Lady Paisley.  Lord
Darlington.</p><br>
<p>[_These people enter as announced_.]</p><br>
